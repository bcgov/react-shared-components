## Primary Button

Primary buttons allow users to carry out an important action on your service, such as Download or Submit.

### When to Use

The most important actions you want users to take on your site.

### When not to Use

Supporting actions on your page such as Cancel, Delete, or supporting information.

<Story name="Primary" id="button--primary"></Story>

```bash
<Button onClick={onClick} label="Submit" styling="normal-blue btn" />
```

## Secondary Button

Secondary buttons allow users to carry out a supporting action on your service, such as Back or Cancel.

### When to Use

Supporting actions users can take on your site.

### When not to Use

Primary actions on your page such as Submit, or Start. Use a `Primary Button` instead.

<Story name="Secondary" id="button--secondary"></Story>

```bash
<Button onClick={onClick} label="Submit" styling="normal-white btn" />
```

## Disabled Button

A button that can’t be clicked and doesn’t react to hover. A disabled button is
greyed out to indicate to users that they cannot undertake the action associated
with it. This is usually for page logic reasons.

<Story name="Disabled" id="button--disabled"></Story>

```bash
<Button onClick={onClick} label="Disabled" styling="normal-blue btn" disabled />
```

## Has Loader

A button that you want to display a loader within, for when an async action is
taking place that you want the user to wait for before proceeding.

<Story name="Has Loader" id="button--has-loader"></Story>

```bash
<Button
  onClick={onClick}
  label="Has Loader"
  styling="normal-blue btn"
  hasLoader
/>
```
